        <h2>What you'll find:</h2>

        <p>In this website you'll find a sudoku game and a sudoku solver.</p>

        <p>
          In the sudoku game, you can try to solve the puzzle by following
          sudoku rules. You'll have the options to give up and see the
          solution, check your answer after filling in the entire grid, do a
          new puzzle, or delete all your inputted values to start fresh. After
          you finish, you can see how long it took you to solve the puzzle.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the sudoku solver, you can enter the hints to a sudoku puzzle,
          and the website will solve the puzzle. The sudoku solver will warn
          you if the puzzle you entered is invalid, or unsolvable.

        <h2>How the puzzles are generated:</h2>

        <p>
          This website doesn't generate its own boards each time you want to
          play a new game. Instead it goes through a database of puzzles and
          selects one for you to play. The databse for this website contains
          2,000 boards. Although, the original database has 1 million sudoku
          boards and was provided by: Kybyong Park. See this
          <a class="about__link" href="https://www.kaggle.com/bryanpark/sudoku" target="_blank">webpage</a>
          for more information.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="about__card about__card--3">
        <h2>How the puzzles are solved:</h2>
        <p>
          The website uses a backtracking algorithm which tests all possible
          solutions for each cell and then backtracks and tries another
          solution when the board becomes unsolvable.
